## Key Features

### Cognitive Activities
Cerify provides tailored exercises that encourage users to stay mentally active and improve specific skills. Each activity is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind:

- **Memory Match**: A card-matching game to enhance short-term and visual memory.
- **Attention Games**: A “whack-a-mole” style game that improves concentration and reaction time.

### Progress Tracking & Analytics
The analytics page tracks user progress, providing insights on performance over time, making it a helpful tool for caregivers and family members.

### Daily Reminders
Cerify sends reminders to encourage daily engagement, fostering a consistent routine that benefits cognitive health.

### Adaptive Learning
Cerify’s algorithm adjusts the difficulty of activities based on user performance, creating a personalized experience suited to each individual’s cognitive level.

## Getting started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

Open the app using a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/), [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/), [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/), or [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go).

### Development

Modify files inside the **app** directory to develop the project further. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for easy navigation setup.
